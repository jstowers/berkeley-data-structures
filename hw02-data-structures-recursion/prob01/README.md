COMPSCIX404.1-015

HW #2

## Problem 01

Give at least two examples (real life and programming) and a short description for:

### a.  Stack

An array often used for storing temporary data.  Data can only be inserted or 
deleted from the end (or top) of the stack.  Also, only the last element can be read.  Stacks follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. 

In programming, stacks are used for browser navigation.  

In the kitchen, you usually place clean plates on top of an existing stack and 
use the first plate off the top of the stack.

### b.  Queue

Can be implemented via array or linked list.  Queues follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.  Elements are added at the back (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue).

In programming, queues are used to manage printer jobs, where the first job added to the queue is the first job printed.

In life, a queue is most common at concerts or sporting events where the person who arrives first is the first person into the venue. 

### c.  Deque

A double-ended queue.  It is a combination of a stack and queue and provides for insertion on both the front and back of the queue.

In programming, deques are used for undo tracking when editing a document or designing a UI wireframe.

In life, deques are used for security cameras where only a certain number of hours of video are recorded and saved.  Deques allow for retrieval of video from either the start or end of a given time period.
